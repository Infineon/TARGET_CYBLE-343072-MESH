# CYBLE-343072-MESH

### Overview

The Infineon AIROC&#8482; CYW20835 Bluetooth&#174; LE 5.2 mesh evaluation kit (CYBLE-343072-MESH) enables evaluation, prototyping, and development of Bluetooth&#174; mesh applications using the AIROC&#8482; CYW20835, an ultra-low-power Bluetooth&#174; LE 5.2 system on chip.

The AIROC&#8482; CYW20835 Bluetooth&#174; LE system on chip provides reliable Bluetooth&#174; LE connectivity, core spec compliant to 5.2, along with high-performance compute capability integrating an Arm&#174; Cortex&#174;-M4 processor with floating point unit. It is a highly integrated device integrating multiple serial interfaces, PWMs, analog and digital microphone interfaces, and more. This evaluation kit (CYBLE-343072-MESH) includes an Infineon in-house AIROC&#8482; Bluetooth&#174; module hosting the AIROC&#8482; CYW20835 that is globally certified and has PCB antenna integrated, rapidly reducing time-to-market.

The AIROC&#8482; CYW20835 Bluetooth&#174; LE 5.2 mesh evaluation kit (CYBLE-343072-MESH) is supported in the AIROC&#8482; Bluetooth&#174; SDK within ModusToolbox&#8482; Software and Tools with copious code examples and documentation enablement for Bluetooth&#174; mesh use cases
